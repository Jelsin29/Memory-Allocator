Memory Allocation and Deallocation Implementation Report

1. Introduction
The code snippet provided implements a custom memory allocation and deallocation system. It includes functions for allocating memory (mymalloc) and freeing memory (myfree). Additionally, it offers various strategies for managing memory allocation.

2. Code Structure

Memory Allocation Functions:

mymalloc(size_t size): Allocates memory of the specified size.
myfree(void *p): Frees memory previously allocated by mymalloc.
Memory Management Strategies:
The code supports the following strategies:
First Fit: Allocates the first available block that fits the requested size.
Best Fit: Searches for the smallest available block that accommodates the requested size.
Worst Fit: Identifies the largest available block that can hold the requested size.
Next Fit: Allocates the next available block after the last deallocated block.

Helper Functions:
Functions for coalescing adjacent free blocks (left_coalesce, right_coalesce).
Functions for splitting blocks (split_block).
Functions for navigating the free list (next_block_in_addr, prev_block_in_addr, next_block_in_freelist, prev_block_in_freelist).

Utility Functions:
numberof16blocks: Calculates the number of 16-byte blocks needed to store a given size.
printheap: Prints information about each block in the heap.

Main Function:
The main function demonstrates the usage of memory allocation and deallocation functions. It also showcases how to set and retrieve memory management parameters, such as list type and strategy.

3. Memory Management
The mymalloc function:
Rounds up the requested size to the nearest multiple of 16.
Initializes the heap (if itâ€™s the first call) using malloc and sets up the free list.
Selects a suitable free block based on the chosen strategy.
Splits the block if necessary.
Marks the block as used.
Extends the heap using malloc if no suitable free block is found.
The myfree function:
Avoids freeing a NULL pointer.
Coalesces adjacent free blocks if possible.
Adds the block back to the free list.

4. Analysis

Advantages:
Custom memory management strategies allow optimization based on specific application requirements.
Coalescing of free blocks minimizes fragmentation and improves memory utilization.
Utility functions enhance flexibility in managing the heap and free list.

Challenges:
Manual memory management can introduce errors.
Lack of error handling for memory allocation failures.
Limited validation of function parameters.
Complexity in maintaining and updating the free list during coalescing or block splitting.

5. Conclusion
The provided code offers a customizable approach to memory allocation and deallocation. Developers can tailor memory management strategies to their needs. However, ensuring robust error handling and thorough testing is crucial for a reliable and stable memory management system. With proper optimization, this code can effectively manage memory in diverse software applications.
